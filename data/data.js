It is located in the shape of an inverted S and has a length of about 3.8 km. Venice, founded in the 5th century, was built on a group of islands in the lagoon of the Adriatic Sea, where deep waters and narrow channels provided protection from attack and facilitated transport. The Grand Canal was the main trade route for Venice, which became one of the largest trading and maritime powers of the Middle Ages. From the very beginning of its use, important buildings and palaces began to appear around the canal, which symbolized the power and wealth of the city. The Grand Canal was important for the transportation of goods such as spices, fabrics and jewels that came from all over the world',
